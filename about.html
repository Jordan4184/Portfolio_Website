                <p>Hello! My name is Jordan Donaldson, and I am on a dedicated journey to become a full-stack software developer. Currently, I am honing my skills in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub and Git, React, PostgreSQL, Swagger, and Streamlit. My passion for technology and coding has led me to pursue this exciting career, and I am thrilled with the progress and knowledge I have gained so far.</p>
                <p>In my current role as an AI Technician specializing in Data Annotation, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for the importance of data and analytics. This position has allowed me to refine my technical skills while applying them to real-world problems, ensuring high-quality data for machine learning models.</p>
                <p>Before transitioning to software development, I pursued a degree in neuroscience, where I diligently worked to receive a 3.9 GPA. My academic journey in neuroscience provided me with a unique perspective on problem-solving. In the medical field, diagnosing a patient involves tests, labs, imaging, and results—an intricate process that parallels the problem-solving and analytical thinking required in software engineering. My experience in healthcare taught me to be detail-oriented, analytical, and a strong problem solver, all of which are indispensable skills in the software industry.</p>
                <p>However, my career path took a significant turn due to personal experiences. After a medical emergency involving my brother and a rock climbing accident that hospitalized me, I reevaluated my career in medicine. These events led me to return to a field I had always been passionate about—software engineering. As a child, I was fascinated by the idea of creating and engineering software, and now, as an adult, I am thrilled to pursue this dream.</p>
                <p>I am a creatively driven individual who is hardworking, focused, and open-minded towards lifelong learning. I thrive in team environments, where I can collaborate, think critically, and solve complex problems. My journey in software development is fueled by a relentless curiosity and a desire to create innovative digital solutions.</p>
                <p>I am now seeking a junior developer role where I can showcase my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue to grow as a developer. I am confident that my unique blend of medical and technical expertise, combined with my passion for problem-solving and teamwork, makes me a valuable asset to any team.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your organization.</p>
